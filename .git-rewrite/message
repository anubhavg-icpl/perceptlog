enhancement(prometheus_scrape source): add support for custom request query parameters (#12033)

* enhancement(prometheus_scrape source): add support for custom request query parameters

A new optional configuration option has been added: `query` to the `prometheus_scrape` source.
The option is modelled as a map of string keys to vector-of-strings values.
This representation allows for multiple values for the same parameter key as allowed by the HTTP spec.
It also mirrors the upstream Prometheus `params` option in the `scrape_config` section.

Custom request parameters provided using `query` are appended to the `endpoints` URIs.
All request query parameters are properly decoded/encoded from/to using `form_urlencoded`.
